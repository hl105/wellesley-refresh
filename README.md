# Wellesley Refresh - A Better Menu for Wellesley

Wellesley Refresh is a better menu for Wellesley College created by Belle (bs107), Crystal (cm123), and Johanna (hl105). We got fed up having to switch through the outdated UI of WellesleyFresh's menu, and have to cycle through each dining hall to see where we want to go for lunch! You know what they say: if you want something done right, you should do it yourself. So, during Spring Break of 2025, we decided to get together and make a better one ourselves.

Wellesley Refresh presents meals at Bates, Stone D, Lulu, and Tower side-by-side so you can quickly decide where you want to go for lunch -- because your time is better spent hanging out with friends! (or studying, if you must...)

## Disclaimer

Wellesley Refresh is **not** more accurate than Wellesley Fresh's official menu. Wellesley Refresh relies on the data that Wellesley Fresh provides, so if Wellesley Fresh says Lulu is serving burgers, so will Wellesley Refresh, even if Lulu actually has fried rice. Another known example is dinner menus showing on the lunch menu -- it's because it's how it's shown on the Wellesley Fresh site! Crowdsourcing menus is a possible solution, and may be implemented in the future, but this poses much bigger technical challenges. For now, Wellesley Refresh is only a UI refresh on the dining hall menus.

## Roadmap

- [ ] add popups for each dish with its description, allergens and preferences, and nutrition
- [ ] crowdsourced ice cream flavors
